# Qusto
Qusto is a project of a restaurant website based in Warsaw, offering a wide variety of meals that can be ordered online or enjoyed on-site. The website was created as a project to refresh and practice working with Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Framer Motion. This allowed me to improve state management skills while adding smooth animations and modern visual effects to the interface.
